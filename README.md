# Docker Compose Collection

This repository contains a collection of Docker Compose configurations for various applications and services mainly for development and production environments alike for personal use. I maintain a separate repository for homelab setup/selfhosing setups in [homelab-nerds](https://github.com/markterence/homelab-nerds)

> Please be aware, that contents can change over time and may not have proper documentation. I do my best to keep up with the latest folder structure, changes and releases, and it may not follow or provide an upgrade path, but please understand that this wonâ€™t always be the case and you may need to upgrade or change things on your own.

Most repo may have the same contents as this one, but with different configurations or additional services. Feel free to explore and use them as needed.
